Graph data structures with node

Code supports a general walk through of graphs @: http://cranialtraumagames.wordpress.com/2014/02/26/thinking-about-graphs/


Handles:

Breadth + Depth first traversal using a queue + a stack (no recursion)
Cycle Detection
Articulation vertex detection
Connectedness detection
Bipartite detection
Shortest Path Finding
Topological Sorting
